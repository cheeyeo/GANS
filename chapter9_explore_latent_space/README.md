## Exploring latent space of GAN

From chapter9 of book "Generative Adversarial Networks"

To generate the dataset, download and unzip the [CelebA dataset] into local directory of `data`. 

Then run `python data.py` to obtain `img_align_celeba.npz`



## Extensions

* Try arithmetic with different image features or different arithmetic and review results of generated faces

* Try interpolating three/more points in latent space and review results of generated faces

* Update GAN model configuration so training is more stable and better quality faces can be generated
